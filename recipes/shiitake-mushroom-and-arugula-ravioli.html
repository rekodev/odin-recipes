    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put the flour and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer and whisk
        together. Add the olive oil and eggs and mix together until it comes
        together into a ball. Attach the bowl to a mixer fitted with a dough
        hook and knead until the dough is smooth and satiny. Cover the dough
        with plastic wrap and let it rest while you make the filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blanch the arugula by putting it in a glass container, adding about a
        tablespoon of water, covering with another glass plate, and microwaving
        for 1 minute. Remove the lid, let it cool enough to handle, then squeeze
        as much moisture out of it as you can.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a small saute pan and add the olive oil. Saute the shallots, garlic
        and shiitake mushrooms until the mushrooms have given up most of their
        moisture (about 10-15 minutes). Let this mixture cool down to room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the arugula, onion mixture, marscapone, ricotta, tahini, soy sauce
        and salt to a food processor and process until smooth. Add the water
        chestnuts and pulse a few times to roughly chop them up (there should
        still be chunks). Prepare an egg wash by whisking together an egg with 1
        tablespoon of water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the balsamic vinegar, honey and demi-glace in your smallest sauce
        pan. Once the demi-glace has disolved and the mixture is thick and
        bubbly, it's ready (this shouldn't take long). I poured the mixture into
        a mini squeeze bottle to make the dots, but you can also just pour a bit
        on the plate and smear it with a spoon, or just drizzle it on top of the
        raviolis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut off a quarter of the dough and flatten it out on a floured surface
        using your hands or a rolling pin, then pass it through the rollers of a
        pasta maker starting from the thickest setting and working your way down
        to a thinnest, passing the dough through at least 2 times per setting.
        If the dough starts to stick, just dust some flour on it. Lay the dough
        out on a long flat floured surface then repeat with another quarter of
        dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        When your second sheet is done, line the sheets up and trim off the ends
        so they are exactly the same length. Place 1 tablespoon of filling a few
        inches apart, leaving room around the edges of the dough so you can seal
        the raviolis. Be careful not to overcrowd the dough or you'll have a
        hard time sealing the raviolis properly. Use a pastry brush to paint the
        egg wash all around the filling. Drape the other piece of dough over the
        first piece and use your fingers to start sealing each ravioli starting
        from one end. It's crucial that there aren't any air pockets with the
        filling as the air will expand while cooking and your ravioli will
        burst. The best way to do this is to seal one side, then use two fingers
        to trace the outline of the filling starting fromt he side that's
        sealed, then seal off the other side, and you should be good.
      </li>
      <li>
        I used a round cookie cutter that's 1/4" bigger than the filling mound
        on both sides, but you can also cut your ravioli with a knife. If you
        are freezing the ravioli, place them on a floured cookie sheet and
        freeze them. Once they are frozen you can put them in a ziplock bag, but
        they will stick together if you don't freeze them separately first.
      </li>
      <li>
        To cook the ravioli, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil, then
        turn down the heat to maintain a gentle boil. If you have a very large
        pot you can cook all 18 at the same time, but I just cooked them in two
        batches. Drop the raviolis in and then they float to the surface they
        are done (this won't take very long). Drain the ravioli and transfer
        them to a bowl. Drizzle with sesame oil, add a handful of arugula, and
        sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Serve the ravioli with
        the balsamic vinegar reduction. Sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds and
        chives on top to garnish.
