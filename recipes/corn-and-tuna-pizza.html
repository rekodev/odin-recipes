    <p>
      If your kids are willing to go beyond plain-cheese pizza, this recipe for
      tuna and corn pizza from Japanese Cooking 101 will let you try a popular
      flavor combo without a long flight to Tokyo. I will admit that these pizza
      toppings may prove to be too adventurous for many families, but if yours
      is up for it, I would totally give it a shot. The main toppings are easy:
      canned tuna and corn. The only ingredient you may need to search for
      however, is Japanese mayonnaise, also known as Kewpie Mayonnaise. But even
      that can be replaced with pizza sauce if you'd prefer. And pre-made pizza
      dough would make this even easier to pull together in in a snap.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Tbsp dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 1/2 Tbsp sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup and 1 Tbsp water (255 ml)</li>
      <li>14 oz bread flour (400 g)</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>6 Tbsp Japanese mayonnaise</li>
      <li>3 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
      <li>6 asparagus stalks, diagonally and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/8 brown onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>3-4 Tbsp canned tuna, drained</li>
      <li>3-4 Tbsp canned or frozen corn, drained</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a bowl of a stand mixer, put yeast, sugar and water together, and let
        stand for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour, salt and olive oil, and knead with a dough hook at medium
        speed for 15 minutes. Put the dough in a medium bowl, wrap with plastic,
        and let rise for 45-60 minutes until doubled.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 480 F (250 C).</li>
      <li>
        Deflate the dough, cut into two parts, and roll into balls. Let rest for
        15 minutes covered with plastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out one ball of dough into a 12" diameter round. Place the dough on
        a baking sheet. Poke the dough with a fork to create holes evenly across
        the surface (to reduce bubbles). Spread 1/2 of mayo on the dough, and
        also 1/2 of cheese. Scatter asparagus, onion, tuna, and corn over
        cheese.
      </li>
      <li>Bake about 10 minutes. Repeat for a second pizza.</li>
    </ol>
