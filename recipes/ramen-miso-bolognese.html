    <p>
      This Japanese twist on Italian bolognese sauce from Not Quite Nigella
      looks so interesting and tasty. Using ramen instead of spaghetti, and
      including white miso paste for flavor, this would make a great dinner on a
      cold winter night. I've never seen fresh ramen in our local store, so I'd
      probably use the dried kind â€” minus the sodium-heavy flavor packets that
      come tucked inside.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 large onion or 1 medium onion</li>
      <li>2 small Japanese eggplants, chopped into 1cm.half inch cubes</li>
      <li>2large cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons oil</li>
      <li>500g/1 pound good quality beef mince</li>
      <li>3-4 tablespoons white miso paste</li>
      <li>1 cup beef stock</li>
      <li>1/4 cup tomato sauce</li>
      <li>800g fresh ramne noodles</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Chop the onion and garlic. Heat a large frypan onto medium heat. Add a
        tablespoon of oil and saute the onion and garlic until they soften and
        become fragrant (about 5 minutes). Add 2 tablespoons of oil and then
        saute the eggplant adding another tablespoon of oil, if needed. Then add
        the mince and brown and cook, making sure to break up any lumps with a
        wooden spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once browned and cooked through, add the beef stock and tomato sauce and
        stir and simmer. Then add the miso paste. Tasting is important here and
        some people really love the saltiness of miso whereas some like it more
        restrained so add it one tablespoon at a time. You shouldn't need to add
        any salt to this as the miso paste is salty. Simmer with the lid on for
        20-25 minutes so that the eggplant is soft and the sauce has thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile cook the ramen as per the instructions. Drain the ramen and
        place in a bowl. Place the mince on top and top with the green onions
        and white sesame seeds.
